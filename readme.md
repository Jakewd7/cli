# GoApp CLI â€“ Scaffolding Tool for Modular Golang Projects

**GoApp** is a simple CLI tool that helps you scaffold modular structures in your Golang projects â€” similar to Laravel's Artisan or Breeze.

This tool is designed for developers who want to build REST APIs or enterprise-ready Go applications with clear folder separation and maintainability in mind.

---

## Features

- Scaffold complete modules instantly
- Includes: controller, model, repository, service, route, middleware, config, and utils
- Modular structure: each module lives in its own `mod_<name>` folder
- Lightweight and project-agnostic â€” works with any Go project
- Installable via `go install` directly from GitHub

---

## Installation

Make sure your Go environment is correctly configured and `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your systemâ€™s `PATH`.

```bash
go install github.com/jakewd7/cli@latest
````

You can now use the `gojake` CLI globally from anywhere:

```bash
gojake --help
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Available Commands

### `create:module <ModuleName>`

Generates a full-featured module under the `mod_<name>` directory:

```bash
goapp create:module Auth
```

Generated structure:

```
mod_auth/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.go
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ handler.go
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.go
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.go
â”œâ”€â”€ repository/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth_repository.go
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth_routes.go
â”œâ”€â”€ service/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth_service.go
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hash.go
```

| `models/`      | Structs for data models                   |
| `repository/`  | Database and data access logic            |
| `service/`     | Business logic layer                      |
| `middleware/`  | Middleware for auth, logging, etc         |
| `config/`      | Configuration per module                  |

## Example Usage

```bash
cd your-project/
goapp create:module Product
```

A full `mod_product` folder will be created inside your project.

---

## Planned Features

* `goapp create:model <Name>` â€” Model + migration + CRUD handler
* `goapp install` â€” Initialize a complete starter project structure
* Authentication presets (JWT-based login/register flow)
* Template support for `.env`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, and more
